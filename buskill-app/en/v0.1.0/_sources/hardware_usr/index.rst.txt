===================

This section will describe how to setup the hardware BusKill cable prior to using the software to arm and disarm BusKill.

For information on how to build and assemble the BusKill cable, see :ref:`hardware_dev`

Step 1: Attach Carabiner To Belt
--------------------------------

First, connect the carabiner (clip) side of your BusKill cable to your belt loop. This anchors your device to your body, so that if your device is taken away, the cable will disconnect.

Step 2: Plug-in To Device
-------------------------

Next, connect the magnetic-breakaway side of your BusKill cable to your device. This lets the BusKill app know that you're sitting at the helm.
