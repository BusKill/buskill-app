# BusKill App

This is the codebase for our cross-platform (CLI and) GUI app for [BusKill](https://www.buskill.in). It works in Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

# What is BusKill?

The quickest way to understand BusKill is to watch our 2-minute [BusKill Explainer Video](https://buskill.in/#demo).

BusKill is a laptop kill cord that can trigger your computer to lock or shutdown when it's physically separated from you.

## Misconceptions

> Q: Self-destruct?!? Will this brick my computer?

A: [No](https://docs.buskill.in/buskill-app/en/stable/faq.html#q-self-destruct-will-this-brick-my-computer). The BusKill app does not have the ability to harm your hardware and our app ships with non-destructive triggers only.
