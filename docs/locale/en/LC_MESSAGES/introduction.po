msgid ""
"No. Advanced users can add triggers that wipe RAM and encryption keys. "
"This self-destruct sequence will make all of the data previously stored "
"on a machine with Full Disk Encryption permanently useless. Note that "
"this \"self-destruct\" sequence destroys the data only, not the hardware."

"**This self-destruct trigger is not included in BusKill by default.** So "
"for most users, the worst that can happen is your machine powers off. No "
