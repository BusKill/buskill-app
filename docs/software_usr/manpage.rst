NAME
====

buskill - Lock or shutdown if your device is stolen (for use with laptop kill cord)

SYNOPSIS
========

buskill [options]

DESCRIPTION
===========

buskill is a cross-platform CLI and GUI app that can lock or shutdown your computer when a USB hotplug removal event occurs.

It's designed to work with the BusKill laptop kill cord, which is a hardware dead man switch that tethers a user to their computer via a USB cable with an integrated magnetic breakaway. If the cable is disconnected (eg by a snatch-and-run thief stealing the user's machine), then this software can trigger the computer to lock or shutdown -- thus protecting encrypted files (eg bitcoin private keys) or current login sessions (eg online banking) from theft.

OPTIONS
=======

::

	-h, --help         show this help message and exit
	--version          print version and exit.
	--list-triggers    List all available triggers.
	-v, --verbose      increase output verbosity
	-t , --trigger     Choose trigger to execute. See --list-triggers for all

	-a, --arm          Arms BusKill

EXAMPLES
========

**buskill --list-triggers**
