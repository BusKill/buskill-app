Opening The BusKill App
=======================

BusKill is a self-contained, portable app that doesn't require installation.

Linux
-----

To open the BusKill App in Linux, extract the tarball and double-click the AppImage.

Windows
-------

To open the BusKill App in Windows, extract the zip archive and double-click ``buskill.exe``.

MacOS
-----

To open the BusKill App in MacOS, extract the tarball, and double-click the ``.dmg`` and the buskill executable.

.. note::

	Due to budget reasons, the BusKill project cannot afford to notorize our apps. In fact, Apple app notorization doesn't add any security; we already provide a means for users to cryptographically authenticate and verify the integrity of our releases using PGP.

	If you're passionate about improving the UX so MacOS users don't have to go to ``Security & Privacy settings`` and click ``Open Anyway``, please make a $200 :ref:`donation <donate>` which will cover Apple fees to notorize our app for 1 year.
