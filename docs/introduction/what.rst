What is BusKill?
================

BusKill is the world's first laptop `kill cord <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_cord>`_--it's a hardware `Dead Man's Switch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch>`_ that executes some user-configurable ``trigger`` when your machine is physically separated from you.

The ``trigger`` that's executed when the cable's connection is severed can either [a] lock the screen or [b] shutdown the machine.

Advanced users can add ``auxiliary triggers``, such as a `self-destruct trigger that wipes the LUKS header <https://buskill.in/luks-self-destruct/>`_, making the entire disk permanently inaccessible (even to `rubber-hose cryptanalysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis>`_).

.. note:: If you `purchase a BusKill cable <https://buskill.in/buy>`_, or use the :ref:`BusKill App <download_app>`, it will only ship with non-destructive triggers that will not cause data-loss.

BusKill can protect the data stored on your (encrypted) device (and any accounts that you're currently logged-into) from a snatch-and-run thief.
